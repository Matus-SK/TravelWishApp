# TravelWishApp
This is my first mini web App project. For this one I used -> Bootstrap, nodejs (with express,bodyparser, lodash, mongoose), ejs. As you can see, at the top there are several locations, each one is connected to the database. So you can store different values for each of your locations. I used mongoDB there, create database with two collections (thought it will be easier for me to display initial values).
